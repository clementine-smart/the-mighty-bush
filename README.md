# The Migthy Bush App
We all love the nature and beauty of Aotearoa. One of the best pastimes in our country is to exploring the native flora and fauna via bushwalks! Our app will allow you to get the best out of Auckland's bush walks by saving your favourite trails, discovering new ones and levelling up your walking with our in-built progression system. We present to you, "The Mighty Bush!"

Built in one week, by [Clementine](https://github.com/clementine-smart), [Finn](https://github.com/MsFinnJ), [Tiaan](https://github.com/tiaan-jonker), [Jesse](https://github.com/jesse-reeves) and [Tai](https://github.com/atmour-tai-mourie), as final project for [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwgYSTBhDKARIsAB8Kuktbb0DWX4Q7kk5pH-HMplNUiMBA60xYTWzpVqCMnxMTEKjYY5zl0_waAg0aEALw_wcB). We learned an incredible amount and had loads of fun creating it!

## Credits
The beautiful illustration pictures used throughout the app is attributed to: [Brian Edward Miller](https://dribbble.com/bemocs). However, the registration and login page background was designed by Clementine. 

The icons used in this app is either designed by us in Figma or obtained from [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/).

In regards to the video: the music, editing, voiceover and recording were all done by Finn. Each of us in the group had a turn to introduce sections of the app. In order they are:
- Introduction, Jesse
- Login page and profile page, Clementine
- Explore page, Tai
- Burril Route and details, Tiaan
- Voiceover, Badges page and outro, Finn
- Get the MIGHTY BUSH, all of us

## Note on the app
We built this as a web app with a mobile first design as you're less likely to take your entire PC out for a hike. It was created in React and in future we would love to turn it into a mobile app using React Native.
